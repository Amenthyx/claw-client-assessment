# Claw Client Assessment Toolkit

> Professional client consultation and needs discovery for AI assistant deployments.

## Overview

This toolkit helps you understand what clients need and deliver a tailored AI assistant solution. Designed for **non-technical clients** — no jargon, no tech specs. Just clear questions about their daily life, tools, and what they want automated.

## What's Inside

### Client Questionnaire (DOCX)
Two-part intake form with a warm, professional tone:

**Part A — Private Clients**
- Daily routine and frustrations
- Digital tools they already use (email, calendar, apps, smart home)
- What they want their AI assistant to do (rated 1–5)
- Integration & automation discovery (which tools to connect)
- Privacy preferences and personality customization

**Part B — Enterprise Clients**
- Company profile and pain points (rated 1–5)
- Full inventory of current tools (CRM, PM, accounting, marketing, support, HR, dev)
- Integration & automation priorities by department
- Compliance & security requirements
- Scale and growth expectations

### Internal Reference Data (JSON)
For internal use only — not shared with clients:
- Platform comparison benchmarks (OpenClaw vs NanoClaw vs PicoClaw)
- LLM model comparison (pricing, quality, compatibility)
- Needs-to-solution mapping matrix
- Skills catalog with ratings
